Spam Detection 

This project is a machine learning–based SMS spam detection system that classifies messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam).
It uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for prediction.

The dataset is preprocessed by selecting relevant columns, encoding labels, and splitting data into training and testing sets. 
The trained model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics. Users can also input custom messages to check whether they are spam or not.
