Movie Genre Classification using Machine Learning
This project implements a Movie Genre Classification system using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict a movie’s genre from its plot summary. 
The model follows a supervised learning approach, where movie plot descriptions are converted into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization and classified using a Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. 
The dataset consists of separate training and testing files, along with ground-truth labels for evaluation, and is loaded directly from a Google Drive folder in Google Colab. 
Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics, and the system also supports real-time genre prediction for user-entered movie plots. 
This project demonstrates practical application of NLP, text classification, and machine learning concepts, making it suitable for academic submissions, internships, and portfolio showcasing.
